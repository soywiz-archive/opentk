Version History:
 
0.1 Initial
- Tokens AL_TRUE and AL_FALSE removed, created new type. see AL.Bool
  Tokens ALC_TRUE and ALC_FALSE removed, created new type. see AL.Bool
- Added AL.Null for convenience when working with C Manuals.  
- Alut: The following functions are not bound/imported. Issue of undoing C malloc to prevent memory leaks.
        "alutLoadMemoryFromFile, alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage, alutLoadMemoryHelloWorld, alutLoadMemoryWaveform"
  Please use Alut.CreateBuffer* functions instead, which have similar functionality and return a Buffer Handle instead.

0.2
- Largely improved documentation, found homes for previously orphaned Tokens.
- The Token AL_DATA is hidden now, as it returns a pointer to unmanaged memory
   where the buffer was located previously to calling AL.BufferData(). (It is usually freed after buffering)
- Added Function AL.GetErrorString()
- Added overloads for requesting/deleting a single buffer/source at a time.
- Added Vector3 overloads where applicable.

0.3
- Using a single changelog now, as the number of issues per file has significantly shrunk.
- Refactored -i -fv -3f functions to be overloads e.g AL.GetSource, AL.GetListener
- Added XRam Extension prototype. Untested, as it requires special hardware.

Todo:
- <TheFiddler> functions with ushort, uint, ulong should be marked with [CSLCompliant(false)]
- Fix Alc.GetStringDevices to terminate with 2 null, and split at 1 null
- Investigate if there exists 64 Bit Alut.dll
- EFX Extension
- Document Alc properly
- Enums themselves require summaries
- Clarify details of SecOffset = 0x1024, // AL_EXT_OFFSET extension.
- Clarify details of DopplerVelocity = 0xC001,
- find a home for ChannelMask = 0x3000,
  Docu is conflicting, mixing MiliSeconds and Seconds.
