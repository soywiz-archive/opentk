[Known issues]

Mono 2.2 and 2.4 fail to compile this release. Please compile with Mono 2.0 or 2.4.2+, or use the precompiled binaries (which also work on the affected Mono versions).

OpenTK.Graphics.TextPrinter fails to render text with newlines or a layout rectangle on Mono. This is a Mono GDI+ bug.

Example documentation may not show up correctly when running on Mono. This is a Mono issue with RTF parsing.


[API changes]

Please note that binary compatibility is not preserved between beta releases.
