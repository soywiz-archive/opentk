The Open Toolkit 0.9.8 Beta -- Release notes

[Overview]

This release introduces:
* numerous improvements and bugfixes to the OpenGL bindings
* improved automatic error checking (an OpenGLErrorException is now raised)

Please report any issues you may encounter at http://www.opentk.com.



[Known issues]

1. Mono 2.2 and 2.4 suffer from a compiler bug that manifests while compiling OpenTK (see bug https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488960). Mono 2.0 and 2.4.1+ are confirmed to work.

If you are affected by this bug, please use precompiled OpenTK binaries or upgrade/downgrade your Mono runtime.


2. Joystick input is not supported on MacOS at this time.


3. OpenGL 3.0 is not supported on MacOS at this time.



[API changes]

Please note that binary compatibility is not preserved between beta releases.



[0.9.8]

1. The 'v' suffix has been removed from several OpenTK.Graphics.GL functions. Please search and replace any of the following functions (list non-inclusive):

Uniform1v -> Uniform1
Materialv -> Material
Lightv    -> Light


2. Several instances of the "Version12" enum have been replaced with strongly-typed equivalents. This is a breaking change that affects programs using the imaging subset of OpenGL 1.2.

If you are affected by this change, please replace all relevant instances of "Version12" with the correct enum, as indicated by your compiler.


3. GameWindow.Resize and GameWindow.OnResize have changed signatures:

ResizeEventHandler Resize(object, ResizeEventArgs) -> EventHandler<EventArgs> Resize(object, EventArgs)
OnResize(ResizeEventArgs) -> OnResize(EventArgs)

Please replace all instances of "ResizeEventHandler" by "EventHandler<EventArgs> and replace "e.Width" / "e.Height" by "this.Width" and "this.Height".


[0.9.7]

OpenTK 0.9.7 replaces several instances of the "All" and "Version30" enums with strongly-typed equivalents. This is a breaking change that potentially affects programs using OpenGL 3.0 functionality. If you are affected by this change, please replace the relevant instances of "All" or "Version30" with the correct enum, as reported by your IDE.


OpenTK 0.9.7 also fixes the naming of several core and extension functions ending in "Instanced", "Indexed" or "Varyings". If you are affected by this change, please add the missing 'd' or 's' to the relevant functions.
