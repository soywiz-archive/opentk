How to build OpenTK:

1) Install nant from (http://nant.sourceforge.net/)
2) Navigate to the Build folder and execute Build.exe (type '' under Linux/Mac OS X).
	2a) Under Linux/Mac OS X, type 'mono Build.exe mono' to build the release version, or 'mono Build.exe mono debug' to build the debug version of the librariy.
	2b) Under Windows type 'build net' (or 'build net debug').
3) The binaries (library, examples) are placed in the Binaries/Release folder.


There are other parameters you can pass to Build.exe. A brief list:

net - build using the .Net framework.
mono - build using Mono.
debug - build the debug version (e.g. 'build net debug').

clean - delete intermediate object files (reclaim some space, the binaries are not touched).
distclean - delete intermediate and final object files (reclaim all space used during compilation).
svnclean - delete '.svn' folders. Useful if you checked out from svn, useless if you downloaded a file release.

vs2005 - create project files for Visual Studio 2005.
monodev - create project files for MonoDevelop.
sharpdev - as above, for SharpDevelop.
