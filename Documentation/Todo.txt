Generic Todos:
+ Correctly implement disposable pattern in all relevant classes (WIP as of 0.3.8).
+ Investigate startup lag.
+ Investigate call performance (5%) (athlon64 venice @2250MHz, Vista Business x64, .Net 2.0 optimized x64)
	+ Dummy managed call:
		+ 100000000 calls/second.
		+ 74500000 calls/second.						<--- With try { } finally { } block
		+ 
	+ Delegates loaded with reflection:
		+ GL.Vertex2f: 12300000 calls/second.			(wrapper->delegate->import->unmanaged)
		+ GL.Vertex2fv: 13300000 calls/second.			<--- 'fixed' statement.
		+ GL.ARB.ActiveTexture: 18000000 calls/second.	(wrapper->delegate->unmanaged)
		+ GL.ColorPointer: 2250000 calls/second.		<--- GCHandle.Alloc and Free
	+ Delegates loaded with constructors:
		+ GL.Vertex2f: 12800000 calls/second.
		* GL.Vertex2fv: 2260000 calls/second.			<--- GCHandle.Alloc and Free
		+ GL.ActiveTextureARB: 18300000 calls/second.
	+ Direct DllImport (import->unmanaged)
		+ glVertex2f_1: 7470000 calls/second.			<--- Unmanaged Code Security active
		+ glVertex2f_2: 14590000 calls/second.			<--- Unmanaged Code Security suppressed


Bind:
* Get ready for OpenGL 3.0 (Long Peaks).
* Fix problems reported on the Tao Framework forums.


OpenTK.OpenGL todos:
* Improve call performance for functions that use GCHandles.
+ Inline XML documentation.
+ Add complete Wgl, Glx, Agl and Glu bindings.
+ Get rid of the "object" overloads in favour of generics.


OpenTK.Platform:
* GLContext class:
	+ Add more constructors.
	+ Add native support for the MacOS X platform (now goes through X).
* GLControl class:
	+ Improve the interface. Add more constructors.
* GameWindow class:
	+ Add input support.


OpenTK.Input todos:
* Make Key class non-static. Static means all GameWindows share the same input!
* Complete the Key class.
* Implement mouse input.
+ Implement other input devices.


OpenTK.Timing todos:
+ Start implementing the Timer module.


Examples:
+ Add comments were needed.
+ Add more Tutorials and WinForms examples.


OpenTK.Math todos:
+ Start implementing the Math module.


OpenTK.OpenAL todos:
+ Start researching the OpenAL module.
+ Take a look at the OpenALDotNet wrapper.
